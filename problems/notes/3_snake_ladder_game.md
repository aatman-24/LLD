## Design Problems: Car Rental System

---

### Requirement

```tex
The game should be played on a board with numbered cells, typically with 100 cells.
The board should have a predefined set of snakes and ladders, connecting certain cells.
The game should support multiple players, each represented by a unique game piece.
Players should take turns rolling a dice to determine the number of cells to move forward.
If a player lands on a cell with the head of a snake, they should slide down to the cell with the tail of the snake.
If a player lands on a cell with the base of a ladder, they should climb up to the cell at the top of the ladder.
The game should continue until one of the players reaches the final cell on the board.
The game should handle multiple game sessions concurrently, allowing different groups of players to play independently.
```



### Identify Flow

```tex
ðŸ“Œ Game Flow
Initialize the SnakeLadderGame

Create a Board with predefined Snakes and Ladders

Register Players

Start the Game

Gameplay Loop

Continue until one of the players wins

Players take turns in round-robin fashion:

Roll the dice

Move the player's icon by the dice value

If the new position has a Snake or Ladder, apply the transition

Move to the next player
```

### Entity LookUp

```tex
SnakeLadder

Board

BoardTransition (abstract class for Snake & Ladder)

Cell

Snake

Ladder

Player

Symbol

Dice
```



### Relationship Lookup

```tex
SnakeLadder (1) â†’ Board (1)

SnakeLadder (1) â†’ Player (N)

Board (1) â†’ Cell (N) (e.g., 100 cells)

Cell (1) â†’ BoardTransition (0 or 1) (either snake or ladder)

Player (1) â†’ Symbol (1)


```

### Applying SOLID Principle | Design Patterns

```tex
Ensure Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in each class.

For example, Board should only handle board-related operations like managing snakes, ladders, and validating movements.
```

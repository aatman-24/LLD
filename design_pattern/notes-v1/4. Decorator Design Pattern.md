Decorator Design Pattern
---
### When to use?
> The Decorator Design Pattern is used when you need to dynamically add or modify the functionality of an object at runtime without altering its structure. It's particularly useful in scenarios where:
    
    Extension of functionalities: You want to extend the functionalities of classes in a flexible and reusable way.
    Avoiding subclass explosion: You want to avoid creating a large number of subclasses to cover every combination of functionalities.
    Dynamic behavior: You need to add responsibilities to individual objects, not to an entire class.
---

### Which problem it solves?
> You don't need to create the classes for each of the combinations possible. 
> You don't need to add behavior in base class for extension. 
> You are decorating pre-existing class by adding behavior on top of it, and that class also can be decorated with other behavior.
---

### Standard Example:
> PizzaMaker, Where we have some pizza and a client can add any combination of the toppings on it, but it is still a pizza. You can have plain pizza with cheese and mushroom
> you can also have with only mushroom, with mushroom-butter-cheese any combination, but what I want is my base pizza remains the same.

---

### How it solves?

> Without using this pattern, I need to create the class for each of the combinations then assigns it to the pizza. But what if we have 10-12 toppings, in such case
it is challenging to maintain code. So that reason let's see how Decorator Pattern can save us!

Pizza: BasePizza is parent class and others are there types. 

    public abstract class BasePizza {
        String pizzaName;
        
            public String getPizzaName() {
                return pizzaName;
            }
        
            public void setPizzaName(String pizzaName) {
                this.pizzaName = pizzaName;
            }
        
            public abstract int cost();
    }

    public class ChokkyPizza extends BasePizza {
    
        public ChokkyPizza() {
            super();
            this.pizzaName = "ChokkyPizza";
        }
    
        @Override
        public int cost() {
            return 100;
        }
    }
    
    public class Margerita extends BasePizza {
    
        public Margerita() {
            super();
            this.pizzaName = "Margerita";
        }
    
        @Override
        public int cost() {
            return 150;
        }
    }

Topping

    abstract public class ToppingPizza extends BasePizza {
    
    }

    public class ExtraCheese extends ToppingPizza{

        BasePizza basePizza;
    
        public ExtraCheese(BasePizza basePizza) {
            this.basePizza = basePizza;
        }
    
        @Override
        public int cost() {
            return basePizza.cost() + 50;
        }
    }

    public class ExtraMushroom extends ToppingPizza {
    
        BasePizza basePizza;
    
        public ExtraMushroom(BasePizza basePizza) {
            this.basePizza = basePizza;
        }
    
        @Override
        public int cost() {
            return basePizza.cost() + 100;
        }
    }

Client:

    public static void run() {
        BasePizza margeritaWithCheese = new ExtraCheese(new Margerita());
        System.out.println("Total cost " + margeritaWithCheese.cost()); // 150 + 50 => 200
    }

>> Decorator class has both is-a and has-a relationship with base class. So itself it is a base-class so others can decorate it. While, "has-a" relation gives decorator class to access to its property. 

### Another Example:

Step 1: Create the Component interface

    interface TextView {
        void draw();
    }
    
Step 2: Create the Concrete Component

    class SimpleTextView implements TextView {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Drawing TextView");
        }
    }
    
Step 3: Create the Decorator class

    abstract class TextViewDecorator implements TextView {

            protected TextView decoratedTextView;
        
            public TextViewDecorator(TextView decoratedTextView) {
                this.decoratedTextView = decoratedTextView;
            }
        
            @Override
            public void draw() {
                decoratedTextView.draw();
            }
    }
    
Step 4: Create Concrete Decorators

    class ScrollableTextView extends TextViewDecorator {
        public ScrollableTextView(TextView decoratedTextView) {
             super(decoratedTextView);
         }
    
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            decoratedTextView.draw();
            System.out.println("Adding scrolling functionality");
        }
    }
    

    class BorderedTextView extends TextViewDecorator {
        public BorderedTextView(TextView decoratedTextView) {
            super(decoratedTextView);
        }
    
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            decoratedTextView.draw();
            System.out.println("Adding border functionality");
        }
    }
    
Client code

    public class DecoratorPatternDemo {
        
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                
                TextView textView = new SimpleTextView();
        
                TextView scrollableTextView = new ScrollableTextView(textView);
                TextView borderedScrollableTextView = new BorderedTextView(scrollableTextView);
        
                System.out.println("Simple TextView:");
                textView.draw();
        
                System.out.println("\nScrollable TextView:");
                scrollableTextView.draw();
        
                System.out.println("\nBordered Scrollable TextView:");
                borderedScrollableTextView.draw();
            }
    }

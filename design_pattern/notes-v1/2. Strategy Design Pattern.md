# Strategy Design Pattern(Behavioral design pattern)

> Using composition rather than Inheritance, Inheritance is not about reusing the code. 

---

### When to use ?

> - When designing a system where multiple classes share common behavior or methods, the Strategy pattern can be used to avoid duplication and promote code reuse. 
> - Specifically, When the children of the same parent class have same behavior among them, that time same code used in both classes. To avoid duplication of code, this is used. 
> - Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.
> - Have multiple related classes that differ in behavior (which I define above)
> - Avoid conditional statements in client code based on the algorithm used.

### What problem is it solving?

Vehicle is parent class, and all other classes are subclasses of it. Each vehicle has a drive() method which is inherited from parent class and some of the classes override it. 

```java
public class Vehicle {

        public void drive() {
            System.out.println("DRIVE AT: 70");
        }
}

public class SportsVehicle extends Vehicle{

    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("DRIVE AT: 240");
    }
}

public class OffRoadVehicle extends Vehicle {

    // same as SportsVehicle.drive()
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("DRIVE AT: 240"); 
    }
}

public class PassengerVehicle extends Vehicle {
    // no change in drive method
}
```

Here, you can see the SportsVehicle & OffRoadVehicle have same drive() method. It is duplication among the child of same parent. What if 
there are 10-15 child and they all are using the same methods, or there are multiple methods which are same in some of the classes. 

To avoid such duplication we need to use Strategy design pattern, which tell us that child can decide which feature/implementation(here drive()) method 
they want to use. 

---

### Solution of the problem?

First, I will create an interface that includes such repetitive methods among children. For ex.. drive()

    public interface DriveVehicle {
        public void drive();
    }

Then, Implement this interface for drive method with all scenarios which are identified among children. For ex.. Here driving very fast and normal. Two scenario I can see. 

    public class FastDriveVehicle implements DriveVehicle{
        @Override
        public void drive() {
            System.out.println("DRIVE AT: 240");
        }
    }
    
    public class NormalDriveVehicle implements DriveVehicle {
        @Override
        public void drive() {
            System.out.println("DRIVE AT: 70");
        }
    }

Then, I update the Vehicle parent class. You can see, I added DriveVehicle interface as empty object. With the help of constructor injection, I allow child to choose which DriveVehicle instance it choose.

```java
public class Vehicle {

        DriveVehicle driveVehicle;

        public Vehicle(DriveVehicle driveVehicle) {
            this.driveVehicle = driveVehicle;
        }

        public void drive() {
            this.driveVehicle.drive();  
        }
}
```

Let's see changes in children classes. 

```java
public class SportsVehicle extends Vehicle {
    public SportsVehicle() {
        super(new FastDriveVehicle());
    }
}

public class OffRoadVehicle extends Vehicle {
    public OffRoadVehicle() {
        super(new FastDriveVehicle());
    }
}

public class PassengerVehicle extends Vehicle {
    public PassengerVehicle() {
        super(new NormalDriveVehicle());
    }
}
```

See how It used the DriveVehicle child classes to decide which drive feature it will use. So now If I need to change fast vehicle speed from 270 to 350, then I need to make change at one place only in FastDriveVehicle. This code is also open for extension you can as much as child classes for Vehicle class.

### Example: Interchangeable algorithms to pay via Credit Card or Paypal.

// Strategy interface

```java
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}
```

// Concrete strategies

```java
class CreditCardPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    private String cardNumber;
    private String expiryDate;
    private String cvv;

    public CreditCardPaymentStrategy(String cardNumber, String expiryDate, String cvv) {
        this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
        this.expiryDate = expiryDate;
        this.cvv = cvv;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paying " + amount + " using Credit Card.");
        // Implement payment logic using credit card
    }
}

class PayPalPaymentStrategy implements PaymentStrategy {
    private String email;
    private String password;

    public PayPalPaymentStrategy(String email, String password) {
        this.email = email;
        this.password = password;
    }

    @Override
    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paying " + amount + " using PayPal.");
        // Implement payment logic using PayPal
    }
}
```

// Context class

```java
class ShoppingCart {
    private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

    public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
        this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
    }

    public void checkout(int amount) {
        paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
    }
}
```

// Client code

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();

        // Select payment method
        cart.setPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPaymentStrategy("1234567890123456", "12/23", "123"));
        // OR
        // cart.setPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPaymentStrategy("email@example.com", "password"));

        // Checkout
        cart.checkout(100);
    }
}
```

Explanation: In this example, client can pay either using CreditCard or PayPal. We provide the client to select whatever method he prefer.
here we write the interface for pay() method, and implement it considering credit card and PayPal options. Under the ShoppingCart class
you can see the constructor injection for choices.

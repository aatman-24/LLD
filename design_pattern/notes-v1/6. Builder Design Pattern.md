# Builder Design Pattern(Creation Design pattern)
---

### When to use?

    When constructing complex objects that require multiple steps or configurations. 
    When the creation process involves numerous optional parameters or properties.
    When the object being constructed can have various representations or configurations. (in our example... CSStudentBuilder & MBAStudentBuilder) which have different subject representation.
    When you want to ensure that an object is immutable once it's created. (You don't expose setter of the base class)
    When you want to improve the readability and maintainability of your code by separating the construction process from the object itself.
    When you have a class with a large number of constructor parameters, which can lead to a complex and error-prone `telescoping constructor pattern`.

---

### Which problem it solves?

    By encapsulating the construction logic in a separate Builder class, it becomes easier to manage and understand.
    It allows you to create objects with optional parameters in a clean and flexible way, avoiding the need for multiple constructor overloads.
    It decouples the construction process from the representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations of an object.
    By using the Builder pattern, you can avoid the complexity and error-prone nature of constructors with many parameters.

---

### How it solves?

    We start with a base class that has many optional parameters. To manage these parameters, we create a Builder class. The Builder class contains setters and steps for each parameter. The actual object of the base class is created inside the build() method of the Builder class, which uses the Builder to assign property values in the base class constructor.
    Additionally, there is a Director entity responsible for handling the sequence of steps (e.g., step1, then step2). The Director ensures that the steps in the Builder class are called in the correct order. The Director class also exposes the Builder to the client, allowing the client to interact with the Builder through the Director.

WithoutPattern:


    public class Student {
    
        String firstname;
        String latname;
        String rollNum;
        String age;
        String surname;
        String fathername;
    
        public Student() {
        }

        public Student(String firstname, String latname, String rollNum) {
            this.firstname = firstname;
            this.latname = latname;
            this.rollNum = rollNum;
        }

        // Problem: We can't have this overloaded constrcutor because it is same with above one. There is no change in signature so it consider same one. 
        public Student(String age, String surname, String fathername) {
            this.age = age;
            this.surname = surname;
            this.fathername = fathername;
        }
    }

    }
    
    // Usage
    public class BuilderPatternDemo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Computer computer = new Computer.ComputerBuilder("Intel i7", "16GB", "1TB")
            .setGraphicsCard(true)
            .setBluetooth(true)
            .build();
            
                    System.out.println(computer);
        }
    }

Builder Benefits:

   - encapsulates the way a complex object is constructed. 
   - Allow objects to constructed in multistep and varying process (some builder/object need to have some steps while others have another steps, it's flexible
   - Hide internal representation of the product firm the client
   - Product impl can be swapped in and out because the client only sees an abstract interface. 

Drawback:

- Code repetition in the builder. (similar to base class)
- Need to have clarity on the client side, which fields are mandatory and all that so based on that we can design constructor of the builder.

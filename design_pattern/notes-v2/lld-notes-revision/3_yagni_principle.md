YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need it)

---

This principle stops us(developers) to over-engineer any solution. Only implement the present requirement rather than imagine future scenario which is not comes into picture yet. That way we write the required code only..because whatever we write comes with cost(development, testing, deploying) so it is better not add until is required. That way we stop ourselves to add unnecessary features or over-engineering solutions. 

Benefits:

Reduced Waste

Simplified Codebase

Faster development
